# Packer Service API 🚀

---

# 🤷‍♀️ What does the API do?
### Imagine for a moment that one of your product lines ships in various pack sizes:
    • 250 Items
    • 500 Items
    • 1000 Items
    • 2000 Items
    • 5000 Items

### Your customers can order any number of these items through your website, but they will always only be given complete packs.
1. Only whole packs can be sent. Packs cannot be broken open.
2. Within the constraints of Rule 1 above, send out no more items than necessary to
   fulfil the order.
3. Within the constraints of Rules 1 &amp; 2 above, send out as few packs as possible to
   fulfil each order.

#### `So, the API can calculate the number of packs we need to ship to the customer.`
